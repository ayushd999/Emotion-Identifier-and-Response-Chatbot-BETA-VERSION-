# Emotion-Identifier-and-Response-Chatbot-BETA-VERSION-
This is a chatbot concept made with Python Machine Learning models and Circular linked list with implementation in queue programmed with C language. This is just a concept version since I am a begineer in this field just experimenting and trying out my skills hope you guys like it
I am giving the .py , .c and .bat file since I have not developed the application yet 
Once you run it you should press y in python window in cmd first then enter the message in other window
Emotion based random response will be generated
Will keep uploading my works :)
